## Brief Explanation

This was a challenge to code an Ecommerce Product Page set by Frontend Mentor. It's definitely the most challenging site I've tackled to date, and I'm pretty proud of the final outcome. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to tweak everything to pixel-perfect satisfaction, but that wasn't my goal.

## What I've learned

I learned what modals and popovers are! I had no clue how to create them before. I found it really encouraging to explore how these things are tackled professionally including best practice, terminologies etc.

## What I struggled with

Towards the end, I definitely felt that my CSS was becoming burdensome. It was like a big pile that I kept adding to and adding to and, towards the end, I was praying it wouldn't topple over! This challenge definitely taught me that it's wise to think ahead so your CSS is as concise as possible - it should be as easily manageable in the beginning as it is at the end, or as close as possible!

And the same goes for JavaScript. The code is definitely not as DRY as it could be - which is okay as this was my first proper crack at more of an 'advanced' website with more bells and whistles. But definitely implementing DRY code next time is the goal.

# Other notes

Due to time constraints, the add to cart panel that shows on click of the cart icon, for medium screens and above, is positioned differently to where it is in the brief.
